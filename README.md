phySCO is a python script that infers maximum likelihood <ins>phy</ins>logenomic tree using BUSCO <ins>s</ins>ingle-<ins>c</ins>opy <ins>o</ins>rthologous genes. phySCO retrieves these genes from already-available BUSCO results (that is, phySCO *does not* run BUSCO itself).

Current version: 1.1.0

Many thanks to [NiccoloRighetti](https://github.com/NiccoloRighetti), whose work has pushed me to start writing this code.

## General description
Given a directory containing BUSCO results for a group of species, phySCO computes the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of all the species.

To run phySCO, just create a dedicated directory and copy into it BUSCO results for the species you want to analyse.
> **Mind to keep the default structure of BUSCO results**.

phySCO is able to process **both amino acid and nucleotide sequences** of complete single-copy BUSCO genes. Nonetheless, its default behaviour is to work with amino acid sequences, as they are *always* returned by any BUSCO analysis run mode (either genome, transcriptome or protein).

## Required softwares and dependencies
Here is the list of software that phySCO requires:
* <code>python</code> (v3.11)
* <code>mafft</code> (v7.505)
* <code>trimal</code> (v1.4.rev15)
* <code>IQTREE2</code> (2.1.4-beta COVID-edition)

You can install all of them directly from the [<code>phySCO_env.yml</code>](./phySCO_env.yml) YAML file, through the command:
```
conda env create -f phySCO_env.yml
conda activate phySCO_env
```

## Example dataset
[<code>example_dataset/</code>](./example_dataset/) is a test dataset that can be used directly as an input to phySCO. [<code>example_dataset_key.md</code>](./example_dataset_key.md) contains metadata of the example dataset.

It has been generated by simply running BUSCO on a random set of mammal NCBI reference genomes. You can find the keys to the species identifier in [<code>example_dataset_key.md</code>](./example_dataset_key.md).

Before running phySCO on the example dataset, run the following commands:
```
mkdir example_dataset_extracted
for i in example_dataset/*tar.gz; do tar -xvzf $i -C example_dataset_extracted; done
```
then run
```
python3 phySCO.py -i example_dataset_extracted/
```
